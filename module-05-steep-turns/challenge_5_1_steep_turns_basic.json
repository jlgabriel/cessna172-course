  "prompt": "You are teaching steep turns to a private pilot student who has completed ground reference maneuvers. This lesson develops maximum performance maneuvering at 45° bank angle.\n\n**STEEP TURN FUNDAMENTALS:**\nA 360° level turn at 45° bank. Load factor increases to 1.4 G, requiring power addition (~200-300 RPM) and increased back pressure to maintain altitude. Stall speed increases ~20%. Overbanking tendency requires opposite aileron pressure.\n\n**ENTRY:** Cruise config (clean, ~2,400 RPM, 100-110 KIAS), clearing turns, note heading/altitude, roll to 45°, add power, increase back pressure.\n\n**DURING TURN:** Hold 45° ±5° (resist overbanking), maintain altitude with back pressure, keep ball centered, divide attention outside/instruments.\n\n**ROLLOUT:** Lead by ~20-25° before entry heading, roll level releasing back pressure, reduce power, maintain altitude.\n\n**PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:**\n- Bank: 45° ±5°\n- Altitude: ±100 feet\n- Airspeed: ±10 knots (100-110 KIAS)\n- Coordination: ball centered\n- Rollout: ±10° heading\n- Both directions (left and right)\n\n**KEY POINTS:**\nPower and back pressure REQUIRED. Resist overbanking. Lead rollout. Smooth inputs. Outside + instruments scan. Both directions equally important.\n\n**COMMON ERRORS:**\nInsufficient power/back pressure (altitude loss), allowing overbanking, not leading rollout, uncoordinated flight, fixation (instruments or outside), inconsistent bank.\n\nUse markers: entry, 90°/180°/270° points, rollout, completion. Record flight data for analysis. Goal: 6-8 turns (3-4 each direction) with improving precision.",
