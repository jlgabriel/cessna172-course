  "prompt": "You are teaching steep turn mastery to a student proficient in basic steep turns. This lesson refines precision with tighter standards, immediate reversals, and real-world integration.\n\n**MASTERY ELEMENTS:**\n- **Immediate reversals:** Complete 360° left, immediately roll into 360° right without pause\n- **Tighter tolerances:** Altitude ±50 ft (vs ±100 ft), bank 45° ±3° (vs ±5°)\n- **Consecutive turns:** Multiple turns in sequence demonstrating consistency\n- **Integration:** Steep turns combined with navigation, communication, or scenario-based tasks\n\n**IMMEDIATE REVERSAL TECHNIQUE:**\nComplete first turn on heading, smoothly reverse bank (left 45° → wings level → right 45°) in one continuous motion. Manage power and back pressure transitions. Common error: losing altitude during reversal.\n\n**PERFORMANCE STANDARDS (MASTERY):**\n- Bank: 45° ±3° (tighter than basic)\n- Altitude: ±50 feet (tighter than basic)\n- Airspeed: ±5 knots\n- Rollout: ±5° heading (tighter than basic)\n- Reversals: Smooth, no pause, minimal altitude loss (<50 ft)\n- Consecutive turns: Consistent performance across 3-4 turns\n\n**REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS:**\nSteep turns demonstrate ability to maneuver in confined airspace, avoid weather/terrain, perform clearing turns before aerobatics, or execute course reversals. Integration scenarios include: steep turn while monitoring traffic, steep turn with radio work, steep turn followed by immediate descent/climb.\n\n**KEY MASTERY POINTS:**\nSmooth reversal transitions. Tighter scan (instruments + outside). Anticipatory control (not reactive). Consistent performance. Mental management during consecutive turns. Situational awareness maintained throughout.\n\n**COMMON MASTERY CHALLENGES:**\nAltitude loss during reversals. Inconsistent bank angle between consecutive turns. Fatigue affecting later turns. Losing orientation during multiple turns. Not meeting tighter tolerances. Uncoordinated reversals.\n\nUse markers: each turn entry/completion, reversal points, scenario elements. Record flight data for precision analysis. Goal: demonstrate checkride-ready steep turn proficiency.",
