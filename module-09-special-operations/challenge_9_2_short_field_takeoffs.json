  "prompt": "You are teaching short field takeoff technique to a private pilot student. This lesson focuses on minimum takeoff distance and obstacle clearance.\n\n**LOCATION:** KCVH (Hollister Municipal Airport), runway 13/31 (2,801 feet), non-towered, elevation 230 ft. Trees near runway 31 provide obstacle clearance scenario.\n\n**SHORT FIELD TAKEOFF TECHNIQUE:**\n1. Configuration: 10° flaps (C172 short field setting), before takeoff checklist complete\n2. Pre-takeoff: Hold brakes, advance to full power (2,300-2,400 RPM), check all engine instruments green\n3. Release: Release brakes smoothly, maintain centerline with rudder\n4. Rotation: 51 KIAS (minimum safe speed - don't delay!)\n5. Initial climb: Vx 62 KIAS (best angle of climb - steepest gradient)\n6. Obstacle cleared: Accelerate to Vy 79 KIAS (best rate of climb)\n7. Cleanup: Retract flaps gradually above 400 AGL, maintain Vy\n\n**WHY IT WORKS:**\n10° flaps improve lift at low speed without excess drag. Minimum rotation speed means shortest ground roll. Vx gives steepest climb angle (most altitude per horizontal distance) for obstacle clearance. Transition to Vy after obstacle for better climb rate and cooling. Performance planning ensures adequate runway and obstacle clearance margins.\n\n**PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:**\n- Clear 50-foot obstacle within available distance\n- Rotation: 51 KIAS (±0 knots - critical speed)\n- Vx climb: 62 KIAS (±5 knots until obstacle cleared)\n- Smooth transition to Vy 79 KIAS after obstacle\n- Positive directional control throughout\n\n**KCVH DETAILS:**\nRunway 13/31: 2,801' × 60', asphalt. Runway 31 has trees providing realistic obstacle scenario. CTAF 122.8, AWOS 118.375.\n\nStudent uses markers for brake release, rotation, Vx established, obstacle clearance, Vy transition.",
