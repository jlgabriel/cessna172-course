  "prompt": "You are teaching complete wind operations with decision-making emphasis. This capstone challenge integrates crosswind takeoffs and landings in challenging conditions.\n\n**LOCATION:** KHWD (Hayward Executive).\n\n**WIND CONDITIONS:**\nStudent will experience strong steady winds (20kt with 17kt crosswind), gusty conditions (15G25), variable winds (270-330° shifting), and extreme conditions requiring no-go decision (25G35).\n\n**COMPLETE OPERATIONS:**\nIntegration of all crosswind skills: takeoff with proper aileron/rudder, pattern with crab, landing with slip method, rollout control. No separate practice - complete patterns only.\n\n**WIND SHEAR AWARENESS:**\nWind shear = rapid change in wind speed or direction. On approach: headwind shear (losing headwind) causes airspeed loss and sink. Tailwind shear (gaining tailwind) causes airspeed loss. Recognition: unexpected altitude loss, airspeed change, increased sink rate. Response: power and pitch to maintain glidepath and airspeed.\n\n**DECISION MAKING:**\nPilot in command must decide: Can I safely operate in these conditions? Factors: wind strength, gust spread, crosswind component, personal proficiency, aircraft capability. There is NO SHAME in saying conditions exceed personal limits - that's good judgment.\n\n**PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:**\nSame as previous: ±5 ft centerline, ±5° heading, touchdown within 200 ft, upwind wheel first. But in challenging conditions, safety > perfection. Go-around is always an option.\n\nStudent demonstrates complete proficiency and safety-first decision making.",
