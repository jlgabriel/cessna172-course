## Key Concepts

### Crosswind Component Calculation

**Formula:**  
Crosswind Component = Wind Speed × sin(angle between wind and runway)

**Quick Reference Angles:**
- 30° off runway = 50% crosswind
- 45° off runway = 70% crosswind
- 60° off runway = 90% crosswind
- 90° off runway = 100% crosswind (direct)

**Example:**  
Wind 300° at 15 knots, Runway 280° → 20° angle  
Crosswind = 15 × sin(20°) ≈ 15 × 0.34 ≈ 5 knots

---

### Crosswind Takeoff Technique

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Before takeoff:** Position ailerons FULL into wind (full deflection visible)
2. **Apply power:** Smooth and full, use rudder aggressively to maintain centerline
3. **During roll:** Gradually reduce aileron as airspeed increases (but keep some deflection)
4. **Rotation:** Normal speed (55-60 KIAS), don't force airplane off ground
5. **After liftoff:** Establish crab angle immediately to prevent drift
6. **Climb:** Maintain coordinated flight at Vy (79 KIAS) with crab into wind

**Why It Works:**
- Full aileron prevents upwind wing from lifting during initial roll
- Less aileron needed as airspeed increases airflow over control surfaces
- Rudder controls direction (keeps nose aligned with centerline)
- Crab after liftoff maintains desired ground track

---

### Crosswind Landing Technique (Wing-Low Slip Method)

**Recommended Method for Students:**

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Pattern:** Fly with crab to maintain runway ground track
2. **Final approach:** Transition to slip:
   - Lower upwind wing (aileron into wind)
   - Apply opposite rudder to align nose with runway
3. **Maintain slip:** Hold all the way to touchdown with constant small corrections
4. **Touchdown:** Upwind main wheel contacts first, then downwind wheel, then nosewheel
5. **Rollout:** Hold aileron into wind throughout rollout

**Why It Works:**
- Lowered upwind wing creates slip that counteracts drift
- Opposite rudder keeps nose aligned with runway centerline
- Amount of bank = amount needed to stop drift
- Amount of rudder = amount needed for alignment
- Upwind wheel first touchdown is CORRECT (not an error!)

**Alternative: Crab Method**
- Maintain crab on final
- Kick out crab with rudder just before touchdown
- More difficult for students, requires precise timing

---

### Wind Shear Awareness

**Definition:**  
Rapid change in wind speed or direction, typically encountered on approach

**Types:**
- **Headwind shear:** Losing headwind causes airspeed loss and sink
- **Tailwind shear:** Gaining tailwind causes airspeed loss
- **Downdraft shear:** Sudden descent rate increase

**Recognition:**
- Unexpected altitude loss
- Airspeed decrease or increase
- Increased descent rate
- Difficulty maintaining glidepath

**Response:**
- Add power immediately
- Pitch to maintain airspeed
- Arrest descent rate
- Go around if severe

---

### Go/No-Go Decision Making

**Factors to Consider:**

1. **Wind Strength:**
   - Total wind speed
   - Crosswind component
   - Gust spread (difference between steady and gust)

2. **Aircraft Capability:**
   - C172 demonstrated crosswind: 15 knots
   - Not a limit, but tested capability
   - Higher crosswinds possible with proper technique

3. **Personal Proficiency:**
   - Your experience level
   - Recent practice in crosswinds
   - Comfort level with current conditions
   - Fatigue level

4. **Safety Margins:**
   - VFR reserves
   - Alternate airports available
   - Ability to divert if needed

**Decision Framework:**
- Can I maintain performance standards?
- Do I have the required skills for these conditions?
- Am I comfortable and safe?
- Would I recommend these conditions to another pilot at my level?

**Remember:** Saying "conditions exceed my limits" is EXCELLENT judgment, not weakness!

## Performance Standards

### Throughout Module 8:

| Parameter | Standard | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Centerline control** | ±5 feet | During takeoff roll and landing rollout |
| **Heading control** | ±5° | After takeoff liftoff, before established climb |
| **Touchdown point** | Within 200 feet | Of intended touchdown point |
| **Touchdown technique** | Upwind wheel first | In crosswind landing (this is correct!) |
| **Approach speed** | 70 KIAS | Add half gust factor for gusty conditions |
| **Go-around altitude** | 300 AGL | If not stable, go around immediately |

---

## Tips for Success

### Crosswind Takeoffs:
- ✅ Start with ailerons FULL into wind - make it visible!
- ✅ Be aggressive with rudder to maintain centerline
- ✅ Reduce aileron gradually as speed builds, but keep some
- ✅ Don't force the airplane off - let it fly when ready
- ✅ Establish crab immediately after liftoff

### Crosswind Landings:
- ✅ Fly pattern with crab - makes ground track easier
- ✅ Transition to slip on final - not at the last second
- ✅ Lower upwind wing, opposite rudder for alignment
- ✅ Hold slip all the way to touchdown - don't level wings!
- ✅ Upwind wheel first is CORRECT technique
- ✅ If not stable by 300 AGL, GO AROUND

### Gusty Conditions:
- ✅ Add half the gust factor to approach speed (e.g., 15G25 = add 5 knots)
- ✅ Be ready for rapid corrections
- ✅ Don't fight the airplane - smooth, prompt inputs
- ✅ Gusty conditions are tiring - limit number of patterns

### Decision Making:
- ✅ Always assess winds before flying
- ✅ Calculate crosswind component
- ✅ Consider your proficiency honestly
- ✅ Making a no-go decision is SMART, not weak
- ✅ You can always try again another day

## Common Errors and Corrections

### Crosswind Takeoffs:

| Error | Why It Happens | Correction |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| Insufficient aileron at start | Forgetting technique | Start with FULL aileron into wind |
| Drifting from centerline | Not enough rudder | Use aggressive rudder input |
| Reducing aileron too much | Misunderstanding technique | Keep some aileron until liftoff |
| Forcing early liftoff | Impatience | Let airplane fly when ready |
| Not establishing crab | Forgetting after liftoff | Turn into wind immediately |

### Crosswind Landings:

| Error | Why It Happens | Correction |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| Leveling wings before touchdown | Instinct to level | Maintain slip all the way down |
| Insufficient bank angle | Under-compensating | Increase bank until drift stops |
| Not enough opposite rudder | Timid with rudder | Use enough to align with runway |
| Landing on both wheels | Leveling wings too early | Keep upwind wing low |
| Not going around when unstable | Pressure to land | 300 AGL stable check - go around if not |
