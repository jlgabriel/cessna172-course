  "prompt": "You are teaching VOR (VHF Omnidirectional Range) radio navigation to a private pilot student. This lesson integrates electronic navigation with pilotage on a cross-country flight.\n\n**ROUTE:** KRHV (Reid-Hillview) → KMRY (Monterey Regional), approximately 45 nautical miles, southwest.\n\n**VOR FUNDAMENTALS:**\nVOR stations broadcast 360 radials (magnetic courses FROM the station). Aircraft receives signal, determines which radial it's on. TO/FROM indicator shows direction TO or FROM the station.\n\n**VOR OPERATION SEQUENCE:**\n1. TUNE - Set VOR frequency on NAV radio\n2. IDENTIFY - Listen for Morse code identifier (must match station)\n3. SELECT - Rotate OBS (Omni Bearing Selector) to desired course\n4. TRACK - Keep CDI (Course Deviation Indicator) needle centered\n\n**AVAILABLE VORs:**\n- SNS VOR (Salinas, 117.0) - Useful for enroute navigation\n- MRY VOR (Monterey, 115.1) - Destination navigation and approach\n\n**CDI INTERPRETATION:**\n- Needle centered = on course\n- Needle left = course is to your left, turn left to intercept\n- Needle right = course is to your right, turn right to intercept\n- Each dot = ~2° deviation, full deflection = 10° or more off course\n\n**STATION PASSAGE:**\nAs you pass over/near VOR station, CDI becomes very sensitive, needle swings, TO/FROM flips. This confirms station passage.\n\n**CRITICAL:** VOR supplements pilotage - don't fixate on instruments. Cross-check VOR guidance with visual landmarks and position awareness.\n\nUse markers at VOR intercepts, course changes, station passage, approach phases. Student maintains 3,500 ft cruise, 105-110 KIAS.",
