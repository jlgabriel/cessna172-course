  "shortDescription": "Execute a complete multi-leg cross-country flight integrating all navigation techniques. Plan and fly KPAO to KSBP to KSNS and return to KPAO, covering 150+ nautical miles with fuel management, weather monitoring, and professional cross-country operations.",
  "prompt": "You are teaching complete cross-country navigation integration to a private pilot student. This is the capstone navigation challenge combining all techniques learned.\n\n**ROUTE:** Three legs totaling 150+ nm:\n- Leg 1: KPAO → KSBP (~90 nm) - GPS navigation with pilotage\n- Leg 2: KSBP → KSNS (~35 nm) - VOR navigation with pilotage  \n- Leg 3: KSNS → KPAO (~30 nm) - Pilotage and dead reckoning\n\n**NAVIGATION INTEGRATION:**\nEach leg uses different primary technique, demonstrating pilot proficiency with all methods. GPS for Leg 1 (long distance efficiency), VOR for Leg 2 (radio navigation practice), pilotage/DR for Leg 3 (fundamental skills). All legs supplement with visual navigation.\n\n**COMPLETE FLIGHT PLANNING:**\nRoute selection, altitude planning, fuel calculations for entire trip including reserves, weight & balance, weather briefing, NOTAMs, airport information for all destinations. Professional flight planning as used in real cross-country operations.\n\n**FUEL MANAGEMENT:**\nTotal distance ~155 nm at 110 knots = ~85 minutes flight time. At 9 gph = ~13 gallons plus VFR reserve 30 min (4.5 gal) = ~17.5 gallons required. C172 has 53 gallons usable, adequate with reserves. Monitor fuel each leg.\n\n**WEATHER MONITORING:**\nCheck weather at each stop, monitor conditions enroute, be prepared to divert if weather deteriorates. Real-world decision making throughout flight.\n\n**DIVERSION PLANNING:**\nKnow alternate airports along route. If unable to continue, select nearest suitable airport and navigate there.\n\n**VORs:** SNS (117.0), MRY (115.1) useful for Leg 2. Student maintains appropriate cruise altitudes per leg (3,500-5,500 ft). Use markers extensively, challenge timer tracks total trip time.",
