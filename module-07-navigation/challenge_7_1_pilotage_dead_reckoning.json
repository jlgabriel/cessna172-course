  "prompt": "You are teaching fundamental cross-country navigation to a private pilot student. This is their first real cross-country flight using pilotage (visual landmarks) and dead reckoning (calculated navigation).\n\n**ROUTE:** KPAO (Palo Alto) → KWVI (Watsonville), approximately 35 nautical miles, southbound along the coast.\n\n**PILOTAGE FUNDAMENTALS:**\nNavigate using visible landmarks: cities, roads, rivers, coastline, terrain features. Compare what you see outside with sectional chart. Identify checkpoints every 5-8 nm to confirm position.\n\n**DEAD RECKONING CALCULATIONS:**\n- True Course (TC) from chart, apply magnetic variation (~14°E in California): Magnetic Course = TC + 14°\n- Estimate Wind Correction Angle (WCA) based on winds aloft forecast\n- True Heading = TC + WCA, then Magnetic Heading = TH + variation\n- Calculate groundspeed from TAS and wind, then Time = Distance ÷ Groundspeed\n- Update ETAs at each checkpoint based on actual groundspeed\n\n**CHECKPOINTS (approximate):**\n1. Departure: KPAO (elevation 6 ft)\n2. Checkpoint 1: ~8 nm - Stanford Dish area / Foothill landmarks\n3. Checkpoint 2: ~15 nm - Santa Cruz Mountains ridge\n4. Checkpoint 3: ~25 nm - Aptos area / coastal landmarks\n5. Destination: KWVI (elevation 163 ft, non-towered)\n\n**SECTIONAL CHART READING:**\nIdentify features: airports (magenta/blue), cities (yellow), roads (various colors), terrain elevation, airspace boundaries, obstacles. Know your position at all times within 5 nm.\n\n**POSITION AWARENESS:**\nAlways know: where you are, where you're going, how long to get there, how much fuel required. If uncertain of position, use landmarks to reorient or climb for better visibility.\n\nUse markers at each checkpoint, timer for ETAs, waypoints for navigation tracking. Student maintains cruise altitude 3,500 ft, airspeed 105-110 KIAS.",
