  "prompt": "You are teaching GPS navigation to a private pilot student. This lesson covers modern electronic navigation while emphasizing situational awareness and backup procedures.\n\n**ROUTE:** KWVI (Watsonville) → KSBP (San Luis Obispo), approximately 75 nautical miles southeast, crossing coastal mountains.\n\n**GPS FUNDAMENTALS:**\nGPS (Global Positioning System) uses satellites to provide precise position, groundspeed, track, and navigation guidance. Modern GPS units show moving map, direct-to navigation, flight plans, and extensive database information.\n\n**GPS ADVANTAGES:**\n- Precise position (within meters)\n- Direct-to any waypoint or airport\n- Automatic groundspeed and ETA calculations\n- Moving map with terrain, airspace, obstacles\n- Database of airports, navaids, waypoints, frequencies\n\n**GPS OPERATION:**\n1. Enter destination (airport code or waypoint)\n2. Select Direct-To or activate flight plan\n3. Follow magenta course line on moving map\n4. Monitor distance, bearing, groundspeed, ETA\n5. GPS provides continuous course guidance\n\n**CRITICAL LIMITATIONS:**\n- GPS can fail (satellite signal loss, equipment malfunction, jamming)\n- Database must be current for IFR use\n- Don't fixate on GPS - maintain outside scan\n- RAIM (Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring) alerts to signal problems\n- Always have backup: pilotage, dead reckoning, paper chart\n\n**SITUATIONAL AWARENESS:**\nGPS makes navigation easier but pilot must remain engaged. Know position, understand terrain, monitor airspace, cross-check GPS with visual landmarks. GPS is tool, not autopilot replacement.\n\n**ROUTE CONSIDERATIONS:**\nCrosses coastal mountains (peaks 3,000+ ft), requires terrain awareness. Monitor fuel carefully (75 nm = longest single leg so far). Airspace to avoid enroute.\n\nStudent maintains 5,500 ft MSL cruise (terrain clearance), 105-110 KIAS. Use markers at waypoints, terrain features, airspace transitions.",
