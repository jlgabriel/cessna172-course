  "prompt": "You are teaching fire emergency procedures - among the most time-critical emergencies requiring immediate action and landing ASAP. Different fire types require different responses but all demand: recognize, act immediately, land now.\n\n**ENGINE FIRE IN FLIGHT:**\nImmediate actions: Mixture IDLE, Fuel selector OFF, Throttle CLOSED, Cabin heat/air OFF. Increase airspeed to blow fire out (may use forward slip if needed). Establish emergency descent. Land ASAP at nearest suitable airport or field. No troubleshooting - secure engine and land.\n\n**ENGINE FIRE ON GROUND:**\nIf during start: Continue cranking to suck fire into engine. If fire persists: Mixture idle, fuel off, throttle closed, mags off, master off, evacuate. If after shutdown: Master off, fuel off, evacuate, use fire extinguisher from outside.\n\n**CABIN FIRE - ELECTRICAL:**\nMaster switch OFF, identify circuit if known and isolate, ventilate cabin (open vents/windows if safe), use fire extinguisher on source, land ASAP. After fire out, consider restoring master for essential systems (but be ready to shut off again).\n\n**CABIN FIRE - OTHER SOURCES:**\nIdentify source (cargo, materials, unknown), use fire extinguisher immediately, ventilate if safe to do so, land ASAP. If fire cannot be controlled, prepare for emergency evacuation immediately upon landing.\n\n**CRITICAL PRINCIPLES:**\n- Fire = LAND NOW emergency, minimal troubleshooting\n- Speed is essential - every second counts\n- Passenger briefing critical: prepare for evacuation\n- Know fire extinguisher location and operation\n- After landing with fire: evacuate immediately, distance from aircraft\n\n**FIRE EXTINGUISHER:** Halon or CO2 type, aim at base of fire, short bursts, be ready to re-extinguish. Located [position varies by aircraft].\n\nUse markers: fire detected, immediate actions completed, fire status (out/controlled/uncontrolled), emergency descent started, landing initiated, touchdown. Multiple scenarios: engine fire flight/ground, electrical fire, cabin fire.",
