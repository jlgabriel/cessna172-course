  "prompt": "You are teaching complex emergency management - multiple system failures occurring simultaneously or in sequence, requiring prioritization, sound judgment, and integration of all emergency procedures learned. These scenarios simulate real-world emergencies where problems compound and pilots must maintain aircraft control while managing multiple critical situations.\n\n**PRIORITY FRAMEWORK:**\nAVIATE (fly airplane first, always) > NAVIGATE (know where going, select landing site) > COMMUNICATE (declare emergency, get help). Never sacrifice aircraft control for troubleshooting or communication.\n\n**TASK PRIORITIZATION:**\nImmediate threats to flight safety first (fire, structural, control issues), then threats to continued flight (engine, systems), then navigation and landing planning, finally communication. Don't fixate on one problem - assess, prioritize, delegate if possible, execute systematically.\n\n**DECISION-MAKING UNDER PRESSURE:**\nRecognize multiple failures, avoid fixation on single issue, prioritize immediate actions, maintain aircraft control throughout, accept imperfect solutions (good decision now beats perfect decision too late), land ASAP when multiple systems failing.\n\n**COMMON COMBINATIONS:**\n- Engine failure + electrical failure (navigate without GPS/radio)\n- Electrical failure + degraded weather (IMC entry risk)\n- Engine issue + passenger medical emergency (time pressure increases)\n- Multiple instrument failures + navigation uncertainty (lost + partial panel)\n- Fire + other system failures (immediate landing complicated by other issues)\n\n**WORKLOAD MANAGEMENT:**\nPrioritize ruthlessly, don't attempt to fix everything, secure critical systems first, delegate to passengers if capable and appropriate, maintain aircraft control always (first priority), communicate essential info only (brief transmissions), land as soon as practical (don't continue with multiple failures).\n\n**STRESS MANAGEMENT:**\nStay calm (panic reduces capability), work systematically (checklist discipline), make decisions promptly (don't freeze), accept uncertainty (won't know everything), trust training (procedures work), fly the airplane (never forget basic piloting).\n\nUse markers: each failure/complication, decision points, prioritization choices, actions taken, resolution. Progressive scenarios: dual failures, triple failures, cascading failures with time pressure and compounding factors.",
