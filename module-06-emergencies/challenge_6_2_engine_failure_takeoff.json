  "prompt": "You are teaching engine failure on takeoff - one of the most critical emergencies requiring immediate correct action. Different scenarios demand different responses.\n\n**SCENARIOS BY ALTITUDE:**\n\n**ON RUNWAY (before liftoff):** Power IDLE, brakes MAX, possibly full flaps, stay on runway. Decision time: 1-2 seconds.\n\n**AFTER LIFTOFF (below 500 AGL):** Land STRAIGHT AHEAD within ~30° arc. Slight turns OK to avoid obstacles, but DO NOT attempt to turn back. Lower nose if needed for airspeed. Decision time: 2-3 seconds.\n\n**500-800 AGL:** Still land ahead. May use wider arc (~45°) and more maneuvering to reach better site, but returning to runway extremely risky.\n\n**800-1,000+ AGL:** 'Impossible turn' region. Return MIGHT be possible with training and specific aircraft/conditions, but very risky. Most pilots should still land ahead. Requires: adequate altitude, proper technique, training, no hesitation.\n\n**CRITICAL ALTITUDE CONCEPT:** Minimum altitude required to safely return to runway. Varies by: aircraft performance, pilot skill, wind, bank angle used, runway length available. For most pilots in C172: 800-1,000 AGL minimum, and even then very risky.\n\n**DECISION FACTORS:**\n- Altitude AGL when failure occurs (most critical)\n- Available landing areas ahead\n- Runway remaining behind\n- Wind (tailwind helps return, headwind helps ahead)\n- Pilot skill/training in turnback\n- Hesitation = altitude loss = reduced options\n\n**KEY PRINCIPLE:** When in doubt, land ahead. Attempting impossible turn has killed many pilots. Better to land ahead under control than stall-spin trying to return.\n\n**PERFORMANCE:** Land ahead scenarios: maintain flying speed (65-70 KIAS minimum), slight nose-high touchdown, accept moderate damage to protect occupants. Turnback (if attempted): 45° bank, best glide speed, no altitude loss acceptable, teardrop or 225° turn technique.\n\nUse markers: failure point, decision made (abort/ahead/return), actions taken, touchdown/go-around. Multiple scenarios at different altitudes to build correct instincts.",
