  "prompt": "You are teaching electrical emergency procedures - electrical system failures without fire. Different from electrical fire (which requires immediate landing), electrical failure allows more troubleshooting but requires battery conservation and no-radio procedures.\n\n**FAILURE RECOGNITION:**\nAmmeter shows discharge, low voltage light illuminated, radios fail/weak, lights dim, instruments fail if electrically powered. Distinguish: alternator failure (battery still charging from failed alternator) vs complete failure (alternator + battery).\n\n**ALTERNATOR FAILURE:**\nRecognize: ammeter discharge, low voltage light on, but systems still working (battery power). Actions: reduce electrical load (shed non-essential: unnecessary lights, one radio, GPS, unnecessary avionics), conserve battery, land at nearest suitable airport. Battery life: ~30-60 minutes depending on load.\n\n**COMPLETE ELECTRICAL FAILURE:**\nAlternator AND battery failed or master switch inadvertently off. Total loss: radios, transponder, electrical instruments, lights (if night), fuel gauges (if electric). Actions: check master switch ON, if still failed then fly VFR, navigate by pilotage/dead reckoning, prepare for no-radio arrival.\n\n**BATTERY CONSERVATION:**\nShed all non-essential electrical: GPS (use pilotage), second radio, unnecessary lights, cabin fans, pitot heat (unless IMC). Keep essential: one radio for critical calls only (brief transmissions), transponder if in controlled airspace, one nav/com. Estimate remaining battery time based on load.\n\n**NO-RADIO PROCEDURES:**\nSquawk 7600 (radio failure). At towered airport: expect light gun signals, overfly tower for signals, enter pattern normally, watch for light gun throughout. Light gun signals: Steady green=cleared land/takeoff, Flashing green=return for landing/cleared taxi, Steady red=give way/stop, Flashing red=unsafe/taxi clear, Flashing white=return to start, Alt red/green=extreme caution.\n\n**DAY vs NIGHT:**\nDay electrical failure manageable with VFR pilotage/dead reckoning. Night electrical failure more serious: no landing light makes landing very difficult, navigation by lights/landmarks harder, consider diverting to lighted airport if possible before battery dies.\n\nUse markers: failure recognition, load reduction, battery conservation initiated, light gun signal received, no-radio approach, landing. Scenarios: alternator failure, complete failure, night implications.",
