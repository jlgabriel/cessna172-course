---

## Key Concepts

### Critical Priorities

**Aviate - Navigate - Communicate (Always in this order)**
1. **AVIATE:** Fly the airplane first, maintain control, never sacrifice aircraft control
2. **NAVIGATE:** Know where you're going, select landing site, plan route to safety
3. **COMMUNICATE:** Declare emergency, get help, brief passengers (but only after flying secure)

### Emergency Decision-Making

**Time-Critical Emergencies:**
- **Fire:** Land ASAP, minimal troubleshooting
- **Engine Failure:** Land soon, some troubleshooting allowed
- **Electrical:** Land promptly, can conserve battery and troubleshoot

**Decision Framework:**
- Recognize problems immediately
- Prioritize immediate safety threats
- Avoid fixation on single issue
- Make timely decisions (good now > perfect late)
- Accept imperfect solutions
- Trust training

### Engine Failure Procedures

**Best Glide Speed:** 68 KIAS (clean configuration)
- Maximize glide distance: ~1.5 nm per 1,000 ft AGL (no wind)
- Establish immediately (within 5-10 seconds)
- Maintain precisely (±3 knots)

**Forced Landing Site Selection (WSSA):**
- **W**ind: Into wind if possible (reduces groundspeed)
- **S**urface: Hard, smooth preferred
- **S**ize: Adequate length and width
- **A**pproach: Clear of obstacles, manageable pattern

**Critical Altitude (Takeoff Failures):**
- Below 500 AGL: ALWAYS land ahead
- 500-800 AGL: Land ahead (turnback very risky)
- 800-1,000+ AGL: Maybe turnback if trained
- When in doubt: Land ahead

### Fire Emergency Procedures

**Engine Fire in Flight:**
1. Mixture: IDLE
2. Fuel Selector: OFF
3. Throttle: CLOSED
4. Cabin Heat/Air: OFF
5. Increase airspeed (blow out fire)
6. Land ASAP

**Electrical Fire:**
1. Master Switch: OFF
2. Extinguish with fire extinguisher
3. Isolate circuit if known
4. Ventilate after fire out
5. Land ASAP

**Fire Extinguisher Technique:**
- Aim at base of fire
- Short bursts (conserve agent)
- Sweeping motion
- Be ready to reapply

### Electrical System Emergencies

**Alternator Failure Recognition:**
- Ammeter shows discharge (-)
- Low voltage light illuminated
- Systems still work (battery power)

**Battery Conservation:**
- Shed all non-essential electrical immediately
- Keep: one radio, transponder (if controlled airspace)
- Turn off: GPS (use pilotage), second radio, unnecessary lights
- Battery life: ~30-60 minutes with reduced load

**No-Radio Procedures:**
- Squawk 7600 (radio failure code)
- Fly standard traffic pattern
- Watch tower for light gun signals
- Overfly tower to get attention

## Common Errors to Avoid

### General Emergency Errors

❌ **Not following Aviate-Navigate-Communicate priority**
- Communicating before securing aircraft control
- Troubleshooting while losing aircraft control
- Fixating on problem instead of flying

❌ **Fixation and tunnel vision**
- Focusing on one problem while ignoring others
- Missing new problems developing
- Not seeing big picture

❌ **Delayed or indecisive action**
- Hesitating when immediate action required
- Waiting for perfect information instead of acting
- Freezing under pressure

### Engine Failure Errors

❌ Not establishing best glide immediately (altitude loss)
❌ Poor site selection (not using WSSA criteria)
❌ Attempting turnback from too low (stall-spin risk)
❌ Not maintaining airspeed control (letting speed decay)

### Fire Emergency Errors

❌ Not shutting off fuel/mixture immediately for engine fire
❌ Forgetting cabin heat off (smoke enters cabin)
❌ Continuing flight with fire instead of landing ASAP
❌ Not evacuating immediately after landing

### Electrical Emergency Errors

❌ Not shedding electrical load (battery drains quickly)
❌ Not checking master switch first (simple fix)
❌ Not knowing light gun signals beforehand
❌ Entering IMC without electrical/instruments (dangerous)

### Complex Emergency Errors

❌ Attempting to fix everything (should prioritize and secure)
❌ Losing aircraft control while managing systems
❌ Not adapting as situation changes
❌ Panicking instead of systematic approach

## Notes

**Important Considerations:**

⚠️ **This is Training:**
- All emergencies are simulated
- Real emergencies require actual emergency response
- This training prepares you but doesn't replace ongoing proficiency

⚠️ **Ongoing Practice Required:**
- Emergency procedures require regular review
- Skills degrade without practice
- Periodic refresher training recommended

⚠️ **Real Emergencies:**
- Every emergency is unique
- Use judgment appropriate to situation
- PIC authority allows deviation when necessary
- Goal is safe outcome, not perfect procedure
