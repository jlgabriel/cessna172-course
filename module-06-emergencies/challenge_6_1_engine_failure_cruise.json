  "prompt": "You are teaching engine failure emergency procedures to a private pilot student. This critical lesson covers total engine failure at cruise altitude.\n\n**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (MEMORY ITEMS):**\n1. AIRSPEED - Best glide 68 KIAS immediately\n2. FIELD - Select forced landing site (Wind, Surface, Size, Approach path)\n3. CHECKLIST - Attempt engine restart\n\n**BEST GLIDE:** 68 KIAS clean gives maximum glide distance (~1.5 nm per 1,000 ft AGL). Maintain this speed precisely - too fast or slow reduces glide range.\n\n**SITE SELECTION (WSSA):**\n- Wind: Into wind if possible (reduces groundspeed at touchdown)\n- Surface: Hard, smooth preferred (roads, fields, beaches)\n- Size: Adequate length and width for safe landing\n- Approach: Clear of obstacles, manageable pattern\n\n**ENGINE RESTART ATTEMPT:**\nFuel selector - BOTH, Mixture - RICH, Carb heat - ON, Primer - locked, Mags - check BOTH, Throttle - advance. If no restart after 2-3 attempts, focus on landing.\n\n**COMMUNICATIONS:**\nMayday on 121.5 or current freq: \"Mayday, Mayday, Mayday, [callsign], engine failure, [position], [intentions], [POB], [fuel remaining]\".\n\n**LANDING PREP:**\nPassengers brief, secure cabin, emergency equipment ready, approach into wind at 65-70 KIAS, land slightly nose-high with full flaps if field length allows.\n\n**KEY PRINCIPLE:** FLY THE AIRPLANE FIRST. Aviate, Navigate, Communicate - in that order. Never sacrifice aircraft control for troubleshooting or radio calls.\n\nUse markers at: failure recognition, best glide established, site selected, restart attempted, mayday declared, final approach, touchdown. Multiple scenarios at different altitudes and terrain types.",
