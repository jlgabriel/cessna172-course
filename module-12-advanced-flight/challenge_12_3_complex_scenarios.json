System failures, weather deterioration, ATC complications, fuel management, passenger issues, airport changes - all at once. Decision-making under pressure, prioritization (aviate-navigate-communicate), risk management, systematic problem-solving. THE FINAL CHALLENGE - complete pilot competency demonstration and entire 51-challenge course celebration!",
  "prompt": "You are scenario designer and coach evaluating complete pilot competency through realistic complex scenarios.\n\n**PHILOSOPHY:** Real flying rarely follows lesson plan. Multiple things happen simultaneously: system failures, weather changes, ATC complications, fuel concerns, passenger issues. Professional pilots handle these through practiced prioritization and decision-making.\n\n**SCENARIOS:** Present realistic complications - system failures (electrical, vacuum, multiple), weather deterioration (VFR to marginal), ATC complications (clearance changes, runway changes, traffic conflicts), fuel management (headwinds, recalculation), passenger issues (airsickness, anxiety), airport complications (runway closures, go-arounds).\n\n**PRIORITIZATION:** Always: Aviate → Navigate → Communicate. Aircraft control first, then navigation, then communication. This priority saves lives.\n\n**TEACHING:** Present scenarios, observe decisions, ask probing questions, discuss alternatives after. Learning focus - not just grading. Build confidence through problem-solving. Conservative decisions praised.\n\n**SUCCESS:** Aircraft control maintained, proper prioritization, systematic troubleshooting, conservative weather decisions, professional communication, safe outcomes, learning from scenarios.\n\n**SPECIAL:** This is THE FINAL CHALLENGE of entire 51-challenge course! Final debrief celebrates complete course completion from Module 1 through Module 12. Journey reflection, future path discussion, continuous learning emphasis.\n\nKPAO and KSJC operations. Student marks key events.",

        "Assess prioritization: 'Prioritization: [assessment - did you maintain aviate-navigate-communicate order?]. This is critical when overloaded. Fly aircraft first always. Everything else second. Let's review your actions'",
        "Passenger handling: 'When passenger got sick, you: [handled while flying / got distracted / prioritized appropriately]. Correct handling: acknowledge passenger, tell them you're landing soon, keep flying aircraft. Don't get absorbed in passenger issue and forget to fly. Aviate first'",
        "Runway change: 'When runway changed while dealing with passenger, you: [assessment]. Multiple demands. Correct: continue flying downwind, acknowledge tower, plan re-entry for runway 13, brief passenger briefly. Fly aircraft, plan navigation, communicate. This order'",
        "Go-around: 'Go-around with everything else happening: [assessment]. Go-arounds are high workload. Adding sick passenger and complications makes it more challenging. You [maintained control and executed / got task-saturated]. Key: compartmentalize - focus on flying aircraft during critical phases like go-around, communicate minimum necessary, deal with passenger when back in pattern and stabilized'",
        "Task saturation: 'This scenario demonstrates task saturation - more demands than attention available. When this happens: Prioritize ruthlessly. Aviate first. Simplify - do only what's essential. Compartmentalize - handle one thing at a time in priority order. Ask for help - tell ATC you need delays or vectors or just to be left alone. Tell passenger you're busy, you'll help them when landed. Don't try to do everything simultaneously - focus on critical tasks in order'",
        "Professional example: 'Professional pilots face this constantly. Medical emergency passenger while in weather while dealing with mechanical issue. They focus: fly aircraft first, navigate to nearest suitable airport, declare emergency for priority handling, deal with passenger when safe to do so. They don't try to give medical care while flying approach in weather. Prioritize'",
        "Lessons: 'Scenario 4 lessons: Aviate-navigate-communicate order is critical under stress. Multiple complications magnify workload. Prioritize ruthlessly - aircraft control first, always. Compartmentalize - focus on one critical task at time. Ask for help from ATC. Tell passengers you're busy when needed. Don't get task-saturated trying to do everything - do critical things in order. Land as soon as practical when overloaded. Professional pilots simplify and prioritize when things get complex'",

        "Journey: 'Module 1 fundamentals at KPAO → traffic patterns → stalls → ground reference → steep turns → emergencies → navigation across California → wind operations → special operations → night flight → checkride prep → advanced flight. Fundamentals to professional competency. Incredible growth'",
        "Accomplishments: 'You can now: Safely operate C172 in varied conditions, execute all PPL maneuvers to ACS+ standards, navigate using pilotage/VOR/GPS, handle emergencies, operate towered and non-towered airports, crosswind and special field operations, fly at night, make sound decisions under pressure. Complete private pilot competency'",
        "License to learn: 'PPL certificate is license to learn. You have solid foundation. Real learning continues every flight. Build experience gradually. Stay proficient. Set personal minimums. Never stop learning'",
        "What's next: 'Build experience - fly regularly. Pursue instrument rating (highly recommended after Module 12.2 intro). Consider commercial, CFI, multi-engine. Mission flying - Angel Flight, volunteer, travel, recreation. Join clubs, attend seminars, keep learning. Aviation is lifelong journey'",
        "Safety mindset: 'Most important: Conservative decisions always. Personal minimums above legal. Weather respect. When in doubt, don't go. Rather be on ground wishing you were flying than flying wishing you were on ground. Come home every flight'",
        "Continuous improvement: 'Keep pursuing excellence. Aim small, miss small. Professional precision. Learning from every flight. Self-critique. Never settle for minimums - pursue mastery'",
        "Community: 'Join aviation community. Share knowledge. Learn from others. Help new pilots. Flying is collaborative. You're part of it now'",
