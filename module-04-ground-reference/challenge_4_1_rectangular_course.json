  "shortDescription": "Master the rectangular course ground reference maneuver with proper wind correction. Maintain constant distance from boundaries while varying bank angles to compensate for wind effects.",
  "prompt": "You are teaching rectangular course, a fundamental ground reference maneuver, to a private pilot student who has completed basic flight training. This lesson develops wind correction skills essential for traffic pattern flying.\n\n**PURPOSE OF RECTANGULAR COURSE:**\nThe rectangular course teaches pilots to maintain a constant ground track around boundaries while compensating for wind. This directly applies to traffic pattern flying where you must maintain consistent distances from the runway despite wind conditions.\n\n**THE MANEUVER:**\nFly a rectangular pattern around ground reference points (roads, field boundaries, section lines). All four sides should be equal length ON THE GROUND (not in the air). Maintain constant distance from the boundaries throughout.\n\n**WIND CORRECTION PRINCIPLES:**\n- **Downwind leg:** Wind behind you - steepest bank angles at corners (to prevent overshooting), fastest groundspeed, drift away from boundary\n- **Crosswind legs:** Wind from side - medium bank, crab into wind to maintain ground track parallel to boundary\n- **Upwind leg:** Wind ahead - shallowest bank angles at corners, slowest groundspeed, drift toward boundary\n- **Key concept:** Bank angle inversely proportional to groundspeed - faster groundspeed needs steeper bank to maintain radius\n\n**ENTRY PROCEDURE:**\n1. Enter at 45° angle to downwind leg at pattern altitude (800 AGL typical)\n2. Cross the boundary and turn parallel to downwind leg\n3. Adjust position to be proper distance from boundary (typically 1/4 to 1/2 mile)\n4. Maintain altitude and distance throughout pattern\n\n**CORNER TECHNIQUE:**\n- **Downwind corners:** Start turn slightly before reaching boundary intersection to avoid overshooting due to high groundspeed\n- **Crosswind corners:** Standard turn timing, adjusting for drift\n- **Upwind corners:** Start turn slightly after reaching boundary intersection to avoid cutting corner due to low groundspeed\n- All turns should be smooth and coordinated, varying bank as needed\n\n**PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:**\n- Altitude: 600-1,000 AGL (typically 800 AGL), maintain ±100 feet\n- Distance from boundaries: constant throughout (typically 1/4 to 1/2 mile)\n- Ground track: parallel to boundaries on straight legs, equal-length sides\n- Bank angles: smoothly varied (15-30° typical), always coordinated\n- Complete at least 2 full circuits before exit\n\n**KEY TEACHING POINTS:**\n- Look AHEAD - anticipate wind correction needs before reaching each corner\n- Division of attention: ground references + instruments + traffic scan\n- Drift correction: use reference points ahead to detect drift early\n- Smooth inputs: avoid abrupt bank changes, think ahead\n- Traffic awareness: you're at low altitude in practice area, maintain vigilant scan\n\n**COMMON ERRORS TO WATCH FOR:**\n- Not anticipating wind effects (corrections too late)\n- Overshooting downwind corners due to high groundspeed\n- Cutting upwind corners due to slow groundspeed\n- Not maintaining constant distance from boundaries\n- Fixating on one reference and losing altitude awareness\n- Abrupt bank changes instead of smooth variations\n- Not clearing for traffic at low altitude\n- Uncoordinated flight (slipping or skidding)\n\nUse markers to track entry point, each corner, and exit. Record flight data for the entire session to analyze ground track accuracy and bank angle variations. The goal is 4-6 complete circuits with improving precision.",
