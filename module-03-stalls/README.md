---

### 3.2 - Power-Off Stalls
**File:** `3.2-power-off-stalls.json`  
**Focus:** Proficiency through repetition

Master power-off stalls simulating approach-to-landing configuration scenarios.

**Key Topics:**
- Simulates approach-to-landing stall scenarios
- Clean configuration (~48 KIAS stall speed)
- Landing configuration (~40 KIAS stall speed)
- Proper flap retraction during recovery
- Building muscle memory through 6-8 repetitions

**What You'll Practice:**
- 3-4 stalls in clean configuration
- 3-4 stalls in landing configuration (full flaps)

- Smooth, coordinated recovery technique
- Performance comparison and analysis

**Performance Standards:**
- Altitude loss: <200 feet
- Heading: ¬±10¬∞
- No secondary stalls
- Immediate recognition and recovery

---

### 3.3 - Power-On Stalls
**File:** `3.3-power-on-stalls.json`  
**Focus:** Coordination mastery

Practice power-on stalls with emphasis on managing strong left turning tendencies.

**Key Topics:**
- Simulates departure/go-around configuration
- High nose-up attitude (15-20¬∞)
- Strong left turning tendency (P-factor, torque, gyroscopic precession)
- **RIGHT RUDDER coordination is critical**
- Power already at maximum (recovery = pitch reduction)
- Stall speed ~45 KIAS with power on

**What You'll Practice:**
- Coordination demonstration phase
- 2-3 stalls with intensive coaching
- 4-5 stalls with reduced coaching
- Total 6-8 power-on stalls
- Constant right rudder pressure
- Wings level throughout (no drops)

**Critical Skill:**
"Right rudder, right rudder, MORE right rudder" - insufficient rudder can cause wing drop and spin entry!

---

### 3.4 - Accelerated and Turning Stalls
**File:** `3.4-accelerated-turning-stalls.json`  
**Focus:** Advanced scenarios and spin awareness

Master stalls in turning flight where load factor increases stall speed - the most advanced stall training.

**Key Topics:**
- Load factor increases stall speed in turns
- 30¬∞ bank: ~54 KIAS stall (+15%)
- 45¬∞ bank: ~64 KIAS stall (+41%)
- Can stall at "normal" approach speeds in turns!
- Base-to-final turn stall-spin accident scenario
- Cross-control stall demonstration (demo only)
- Spin awareness and recovery

**What You'll Practice:**
- Load factor theory demonstration
- 3-4 stalls in 30¬∞ bank
- 2-3 stalls in 45¬∞ bank
- Cross-control stall demo (observation only)
- Perfect coordination throughout
- Wings level recovery

**Safety Critical:**
- NEVER practice banks steeper than 45¬∞
- NEVER practice cross-controlled stalls solo
- Ball centered throughout is ESSENTIAL
- Uncoordinated turning stall = likely spin

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Considerations

### Altitude Requirements
- **Minimum entry altitude:** 3,000 feet AGL
- **Recommended:** 3,500-4,000 feet AGL
- **Turning stalls:** 4,000+ feet AGL (use more altitude)
- Always maintain adequate buffer above terrain

### Mandatory Safety Procedures
1. **Clearing Turns:** ALWAYS perform before each stall
   - 90¬∞ turn left, scan for traffic
   - 90¬∞ turn right, scan for traffic
   - Check above and below

2. **Area Selection:**
   - Away from airports and traffic
   - Clear of clouds and terrain
   - Good visibility
   - Over unpopulated areas when possible

3. **Pre-Maneuver Checklist:**
   - Altitude adequate
   - Area clear
   - Engine parameters normal
   - Mixture full rich (for power-on stalls)
   - Seat belts tight

### Spin Awareness
- **If spin entry occurs:**
  - Opposite rudder immediately
  - Forward elevator (reduce angle of attack)
  - Power idle
  - Level wings
  - Recover from dive

- **Prevention:**
  - Maintain coordinated flight (ball centered)
  - Watch for any wing drop, correct immediately
  - Never practice cross-controlled stalls solo
  - Never exceed 45¬∞ bank in stall practice

---

## üìä Performance Standards

### Recovery Technique (PARE)
- **P**ower: Full power (or already at full for power-on)
- **A**ttitude: Reduce angle of attack (forward pressure)
- **R**udder: Coordinate to prevent yaw
- **E**levator: Return to level flight smoothly

### Target Performance
| Parameter | Standard | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Altitude Loss** | <200 feet | Power-off and power-on |
| | <300 feet | Turning stalls (acceptable) |
| **Heading** | ¬±10¬∞ | During recovery |
| **Recovery Point** | First indication | Not full stall break |
| **Coordination** | Ball centered | Critical for turning stalls |
| **Secondary Stall** | None | Smooth recovery |

## üéì Prerequisites

Before starting Module 3, you should have:

- ‚úÖ Completed Module 1: Fundamentals
- ‚úÖ Completed Module 2: Traffic Pattern
- ‚úÖ Comfortable with basic flight maneuvers
- ‚úÖ Proficient in climb and descent control
- ‚úÖ Good altitude and heading control
- ‚úÖ Understanding of coordination (ball centered)

---

## üí° Tips for Success

### For Stall Recognition (3.1)
- Focus on the subtle signs first (mushy controls)
- Don't wait for the stall horn - that's a late warning
- Verbalize what you feel during each approach
- Recovery at FIRST indication, not full stall

### For Power-Off Stalls (3.2)
- Relax! These are relatively benign if properly executed
- Full power immediately in recovery
- Retract flaps AFTER positive climb established
- Watch your altitude loss trend - it should improve

### For Power-On Stalls (3.3)
- **RIGHT RUDDER is the key** - can't emphasize enough
- Feel significant pressure on right rudder pedal
- Watch the ball constantly
- High nose attitude is normal - don't be intimidated
- Recovery is pitch reduction, not power addition

### For Turning Stalls (3.4)
- Understand you can stall at "normal" airspeeds
- 64 KIAS in a 45¬∞ bank = AT STALL SPEED!
- Coordination is CRITICAL - any slip = spin risk
- Never use bottom rudder to "tighten" a turn
- If overshooting final in real life: GO AROUND

## üö´ Common Errors

### All Stalls
- ‚ùå Not performing clearing turns
- ‚ùå Insufficient altitude for practice
- ‚ùå Excessive forward pressure during recovery (porpoising)
- ‚ùå Secondary stall from raising nose too quickly
- ‚ùå Not adding full power immediately (power-off stalls)

### Power-On Stalls Specific
- ‚ùå Insufficient right rudder (THE most common error)
- ‚ùå Using aileron to prevent wing drop instead of rudder
- ‚ùå Not maintaining coordination during entry
- ‚ùå Letting nose get too high before recovery

### Turning Stalls Specific
- ‚ùå Not maintaining coordinated flight (ball off center)
- ‚ùå Not recognizing higher stall speeds in turns
- ‚ùå Practicing banks steeper than 45¬∞
- ‚ùå Using bottom rudder in turns (spin setup)
- ‚ùå Not leveling wings during recovery

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Safety Reminders

1. **Altitude is your friend:** Never practice below 3,000 AGL
2. **Clearing turns are mandatory:** Not optional, ever
3. **Coordination is critical:** Especially in turning stalls
4. **Recovery at first indication:** Don't wait for full break
5. **If in doubt, go around:** Never force a maneuver
6. **Spin awareness:** Know how to recover if needed
7. **Never solo practice:** Cross-controlled stalls, spins

## üéâ Congratulations!

Completing Module 3 is a major milestone in your training. Stall recognition and recovery is one of the most important safety skills you'll develop as a pilot. You now have the knowledge and muscle memory to handle stalls in any configuration.

Remember: The goal is never to stall the aircraft in real flight - but if you do, you now know exactly what to do.

**Stay safe, fly coordinated, and see you in Module 4!** ‚úàÔ∏è
