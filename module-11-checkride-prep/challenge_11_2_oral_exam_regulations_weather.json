        "Ask: 'What is the PAVE checklist for risk assessment?'",
        "Explain: 'Pilot, Aircraft, enVironment, External pressures. Pilot: IMSAFE, experience, currency. Aircraft: airworthy, equipped, fuel. enVironment: weather, terrain, airport. External pressures: schedule, passengers wanting to go, financial'",

        "Explain: 'Self-imposed limits more conservative than regulations. Examples: 2,000 ft ceilings instead of 1,000 ft minimum, 5SM visibility instead of 3SM, 15 knot crosswind limit. Build experience gradually. As experience grows, minimums can expand toward regulatory limits - but never exceed them!'",

        "Detail: 'Identify hazards (weather, fatigue, unfamiliar airport, night, etc). Assess likelihood and severity of each. Likelihood x Severity = Risk level.

Not legal VFR - can't maintain cloud clearances. Options: wait for improvement, get special VFR clearance (clear of clouds, 1SM vis), cancel. Don't launch into this!'",

Options: proceed if legal and comfortable, divert to airport with better weather nearby, return home. Calculate fuel: need 30 min to reach + 30 min reserve minimum = 1.0 hour minimum. You have 1.5 = adequate but not huge cushion. If weather at destination acceptable and alternate nearby = reasonable to proceed. But monitor weather!'",

        "Guide: 'NO! Private pilot cannot fly for compensation or hire. Even if friend offers money voluntarily, accepting it = compensation. Exceptions: pro-rata expense sharing (pilot pays fair share too), limited scenarios like charity events. This scenario = definitely illegal!'",
        "Scenario 4: 'Last flew 95 days ago. Today is beautiful day, want to take spouse flying. Legal?'",

If ground elevation is 3,000 MSL, then 6,500 MSL = 3,500 AGL = should be 5,500 or 7,500 (odd). Need to know terrain elevation! General answer: 090° = ODD + 500'",
