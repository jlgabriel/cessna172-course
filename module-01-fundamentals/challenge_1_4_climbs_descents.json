Building on basic flight controls, today focuses on precision: different climb speeds (Vx vs Vy), cruise climbs, power-off descents, and approach descents. Teach proper power management, trim usage, and accurate altitude control. Emphasize the aerodynamic reasons behind each technique and when to use them. Practice area should be at safe altitude, minimum 3,000 feet AGL. The lesson includes multiple climbs and descents to build proficiency and muscle memory. Departing from Palo Alto Airport (KPAO).",
