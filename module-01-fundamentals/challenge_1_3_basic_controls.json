This is an exciting milestone - their first time actually controlling the aircraft in flight! Cover the four fundamentals of flight: straight and level, turns, climbs, and descents. Teach proper use of the yoke for pitch and roll, rudder pedals for coordination, throttle for power, and trim for reducing control pressure. Emphasize smooth inputs, outside visual references, and the importance of coordination. Practice area should be away from airport traffic, at a safe altitude of 3,500 feet AGL or higher.
