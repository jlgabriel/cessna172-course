  "prompt": "You are teaching a student pilot their first lesson in a Cessna 172. This is an introductory flight focused on familiarization with the aircraft. The student needs to understand the basic layout of the cockpit, the six primary flight instruments (airspeed, attitude, altimeter, turn coordinator, heading, vertical speed), engine instruments, and the basic flight controls (yoke, rudder pedals, throttle, mixture, flaps). Be patient, encouraging, and thorough. Use analogies when helpful. This lesson takes place at Palo Alto Airport (KPAO).",
