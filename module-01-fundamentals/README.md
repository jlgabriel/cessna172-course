### 1.4 - Climbs and Descents
**Duration:** ~75 minutes  
**Focus:** Precision altitude control, different climb/descent techniques

Master various climb and descent techniques:
- **Vx** (Best Angle): 62 KIAS - steepest climb
- **Vy** (Best Rate): 79 KIAS - fastest altitude gain
- **Cruise Climb**: 90-100 KIAS - cooling and visibility

---

### 1.5 - Slow Flight
**Duration:** ~75 minutes  
**Focus:** Flight at minimum controllable airspeed, stall awareness

Fly at the edge of the envelope to build awareness and control:
- **Clean configuration**: 55-60 KIAS, no flaps
- **Landing configuration**: 50-55 KIAS, full flaps
- Gentle turns and altitude changes while slow
- Recognition of stall warning signs

**Key Learning Points:**
- **Critical concept:** At slow speeds, power controls altitude and pitch controls airspeed
- Mushy control feel
- High power requirement
- Stall warning recognition (buffet, horn)
- Connection to landing approach

**Performance Standards:**
- Maintain slow flight altitude ¬±100 feet
- Maintain airspeed ¬±5 knots
- Perform coordinated turns up to 15¬∞ bank
- Recognize approach to stall
- Execute smooth recoveries

---

## Prerequisites

- None - this is the starting point for flight training
- Ground school knowledge helpful but not required
- Basic understanding of aviation concepts recommended

---

## Recommended Study Materials

Before starting this module, students should review:
- Cessna 172 Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH)
- FAA Airplane Flying Handbook Chapter 3 & 4
- FAA Student Pilot Guide
- KPAO airport diagram and information

**Online Resources:**
- [KPAO Airport Information](https://airnav.com/airport/KPAO)
- [FAA Airplane Flying Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook/)

## Common Student Challenges

### Challenge 1.1-1.2 (Ground Lessons)
- **Information overload** - Take notes, ask questions, review between lessons
- **Memorizing checklist items** - Focus on understanding WHY, not just WHAT

### Challenge 1.3 (First Flight)
- **Overcontrolling** - Relax grip, use small inputs, let the airplane fly
- **Fixating on instruments** - Look outside primarily, instruments are backup
- **Tension** - Breathe, relax shoulders, enjoy the experience

### Challenge 1.4 (Precision Work)
- **Chasing altitudes** - Make small corrections, use trim
- **Forgetting carburetor heat** - Build the habit early
- **Leading level-offs** - Use the 10% rule consistently

### Challenge 1.5 (Slow Flight)
- **Using pitch to control altitude** - Remember: power = altitude at slow speeds
- **Insufficient right rudder** - High power = more left-turning tendency
- **Fear of stalling** - This is a safe environment to explore the envelope

---

## Safety Considerations

### Minimum Altitudes
- Airwork: 3,000 feet AGL minimum
- Slow flight practice: 3,500 feet AGL recommended
- Always maintain altitude awareness

### Traffic Awareness
- Perform clearing turns before each maneuver
- Maintain visual scanning
- Use practice area away from traffic patterns
- Monitor CTAF/tower frequency

### Weather Minimums (Student)
- VFR conditions required
- Ceiling: 3,000 feet AGL minimum
- Visibility: 5 miles minimum
- Winds: 10 knots or less recommended
- No turbulence or convective activity

## Instructor Notes

### Teaching Sequence
This module is designed for 5 lessons but can be adapted:
- Fast learners: May combine 1.1 and 1.2 into one session
- Slower pace: Can split 1.3 into two lessons (straight/level & turns separate from climbs/descents)

### Key Teaching Points
- **Build confidence gradually** - Don't rush fundamentals
- **Emphasize safety culture** - Checklists and procedures matter
- **Use positive reinforcement** - First flights are memorable
- **Connect concepts** - Show how each lesson builds on previous

### Common Instructor Errors to Avoid
- Information overload in early lessons
- Taking controls too quickly (let student work through problems)
- Not explaining the "why" behind procedures
- Moving too fast through fundamentals
