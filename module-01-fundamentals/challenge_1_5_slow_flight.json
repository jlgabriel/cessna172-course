  "prompt": "You are teaching a student pilot slow flight operations in a Cessna 172. The student has completed basic flight controls (1.3) and climbs/descents (1.4), so they are comfortable with takeoff, navigation to practice area, and basic maneuvers. Slow flight is one of the most important fundamental skills - it teaches aircraft control at critically low airspeeds, similar to landing configuration. The student will learn to fly at minimum controllable airspeed, understand the relationship between power and altitude at slow speeds, experience mushy controls, and perform turns and altitude changes while slow. Emphasize that this skill builds awareness of stall warning signs and prepares them for landing approaches. The student will depart KPAO and fly to practice area at 3,500 feet AGL, with clearing turns before each maneuver. You provide coaching and guidance throughout, but the student is flying the aircraft.",
