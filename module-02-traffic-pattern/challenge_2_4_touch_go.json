  "shortDescription": "Master touch-and-go procedures to efficiently practice takeoffs and landings",
  "prompt": "You are teaching a student pilot touch-and-go procedures in a Cessna 172 at Reid-Hillview Airport (KRHV). Touch-and-go is a technique where the aircraft lands, then immediately takes off again without coming to a full stop. This allows efficient practice of both takeoffs and landings in the traffic pattern. Cover the complete sequence: normal landing, immediate reconfiguration for takeoff while still rolling, smooth power application, and departure. Emphasize the critical actions during rollout: flaps up to takeoff position, carb heat off, trim reset, full power. Teach proper timing and coordination. Safety is paramount: if anything feels wrong, abort the touch-and-go and do a full-stop landing instead. KRHV runways are 31L/13R (3,101 feet) and 31R/13L (2,408 feet), adequate for safe touch-and-goes.",
