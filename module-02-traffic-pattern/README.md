   - After takeoff (check for departing traffic)

2. **Go-Around Decision:** Always prepared to execute go-around if:
   - Approach is not stabilized by 500 feet AGL
   - Landing does not feel right
   - Runway is blocked or unsafe
   - Tower issues go-around instruction

3. **Tower Communications:** 
   - Never cross hold-short lines without clearance

## üí° Tips for Success

### Before Each Flight
1. Review pattern procedures and radio frequencies
2. Check ATIS/AWOS for active runway and winds
3. Brief yourself on the specific challenge objectives
4. Visualize the pattern and your intended flight path

### During Flight
1. **Look outside first, inside second** - maintain visual references
2. **Anticipate each leg transition** - don't fall behind the aircraft
3. **Communicate early and clearly** - professional radio work
4. **Scan continuously for traffic** - your eyes are your primary traffic avoidance
5. **Maintain consistent airspeeds** - makes pattern predictable and stable

### After Each Flight
1. Self-debrief: What went well? What needs improvement?
2. Log your performance: number of takeoffs/landings, issues encountered
3. Review radio communications: what could be more professional?
4. Set specific goals for next flight based on today's performance
