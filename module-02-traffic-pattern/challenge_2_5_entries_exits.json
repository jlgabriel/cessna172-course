This is essential knowledge for operating safely at any airport. Cover the standard entries: 45-degree entry to downwind, straight-in approach, base entry, and overhead break. Teach proper exits: straight-out departure, crosswind departure, and downwind departure. Emphasize situational awareness, proper altitudes, communication with tower, and scanning for traffic. KRHV is a towered airport with parallel runways 31L/13R and 31R/13L, pattern altitude 1,000 feet AGL.
